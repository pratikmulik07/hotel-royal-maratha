          ranking index. The city has emerged as a major hub for information
          technology parks and engineering and manufacturing industries. Let us

          An essential part of your Pune experience has to be its varied, yet
          simple cuisine. Try out our restaurants and let our chefs prepare
          authentic dishes with fresh ingredients sourced locally. No need to
          worry about the calories building up, as a quick workout in our
          state-of-the-art fitness centre or a few laps in our leisure hotel's
          swimming pool will help take the guilt away! Alternately, you might
          like to work up a sweat with a jog along the track that meanders
          through the man-made wall of Balewadi Stadium or enjoy some indoor
          recreation or even a game of pool in The Bar.
